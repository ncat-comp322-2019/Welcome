# Welcome
Welcome to COMP 322 - Internet Systems 

Greetings Scholars,

It is my pleasure to be your instructor for **COMP 322 Internet Systems at Noth Carolina A&T State University**. In this GitHub Classroom I will post the following:

* *assignments*
* *in-class activities* 
* *projects*
* *group assignments* 

You will work individually or either in assigned groups to not only learn about git/github but also to learn how to work collaboratively. GitHub is a real world tool that you may use in the future as software engineer/developer. Using this application will also allow you to showcase your work and abilities. The very first thing I would like you to do is create your very own octocat (https://myoctocat.com).

I'll share mine first!

I look forward to seeing that great work that you will complete this semester!


Happy Coding!

Dr. Day
