# Welcome
Welcome to COMP 322 - Internet Systems 

Greetings Scholars,

It is my pleasure to be your instructor for COMP 322 Internet Systems at Noth Carolina A&T State University. In this GitHub Classroom I will post assignments, in-class activities, projects, and group assignments. You will work either individually or in assigned groups to not only learn about git/github but also to learn how to work collaboratively. GitHub is a real world tool that you may use in the future as software engineers/developers. Using this application will also allow you to showcase your work and abilities. The very first thing I would like you to do is create your very own octocat. I'll share mine first

Sincerely,

Dr. Day
